# Salim and Sarah's Wedding Invitation Website - Version 2 (For Mom's Guests) üíç

Welcome to my very first project‚Äîa special wedding invitation website I created for my beloved sister, Sarah, and her fianc√©, Salim. I built two distinct versions of the website: one designed for Sarah's guests and another customized for our mom's guests. üíì
